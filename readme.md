# Strategy

The strategy for the website is that we needed a drag and drop. So, when any user drag and drop the instrument on the drag and drop box it should start playing the music only related to the instrument and when we click on pause it should pause the music.

# Technology used

HTML , CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
HTML to give the structure of the website.
CSS to beautify the website.
JAVASCRIPT to apply business logic

# Bugs and Coding improvements

The first bug I encounter was in play and pause.
When I click on pause it pauses the music but once again when I clicked on play, it unable to play the music and dancing of the man. So, to fix this we defined a global variable isplaying which save the state of the player .
